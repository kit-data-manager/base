    <title>JPA reference implementation of KIT Data Manager MetaDataManagement.</title>
  </head>

    <h1>JPA implementation of MetadataManagement</h1>
    The package contains the reference implementations of the KIT Data Manager MetaDataManagement. 
    This implementation wraps the Java Persistence API (JPA) and allows to access relational databases of various types. 
    However, there are some limitations compared to using JPA directly:
    <ul>
      <li>No Caching - Caches are actively empties whereever possible. Caching should also be disabled in the persistence.xml. 
        This decision was mainly made due to problems with caching and committing entities between multiple instances of the MetaDataManagement.</li>
      <li>No Thread-Safety (similar to JPA) - The implementation class MetaDataManagerJpa is not thread-safe (comparable to EntityManager in JPA). 
        An instance should not be used by multiple threads. Please call MetaDataManagement.getMetaDataManagement().getMetaDataManager() 
        each time you want to access the database and close the returned IMetaDataManager using close() if not longer needed to free resources.</li>
      <li>No control over transactions - Transactions are handled in the recommended way automatically in the background. However, due to the missing caching features 
        for each modify operation a transaction is used and there is no way perform multiple operations within one transaction.</li>
      <li>Decreased Performance - Mainly due to the missing support for caching the performance might be lower compared to using JPA directly.</li>
    </ul>
    By default the EclipseLink JPA implementation is used and was tested. Other JPA implementation may also work out of the box but are not supported directly.
