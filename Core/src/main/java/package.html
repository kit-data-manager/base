        The Core module is actually no source code module but contains all base libraries needed for KIT Data Manager Web applications (ReST-only or UI-based).
        It contains all generic base libraries, e.g. for MetaDataManagement, BaseMetaData- and DataOrganization-Entities. Community-specific dependencies like 
        content metadata or enhanced search must be added externally. Including the module is rather simple and can be achieved by adding the Maven artifact edu.kit.dama.Core of 
        type 'war' to the project. During build the WAR file will be processed as overlay and is integrated into the child project's WAR.
