Migration of Digital Objects
----------------------------
The migration tools for Digital Objects provide extraction and insertion of Digital Objects in order 
to move Digital Objects between two or more KIT-DM repository instances. 

The Utils module (maven module) contains the migration code. The class `CreateMigrationObject` and 
`MigrateObject` extract and insert a migration object (class `MirgrationObject`) as an xml file to 
the given path. Currently it is hard coded. 

The state of the metadata migration is depicted in the following table.

|=======================================
|Component        |Extraction |Insertion
|Basemetadata     |done       |done
|DataOrganization |-          |-
|Data             |-          |-
|=======================================

As soon as all components are available, a migration tool will wrap all the components into
a nice command line client. There is an idea about creating an RESTful migration service 
but it is not necessary to decide yet.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The migration from the xml file to the destination repository will check if the entities are 
already present in the destination repository. If something is missing, it will be added. 
This is necessary because two Digital Objects from the same investigation will not create 
two different investigations.

The following section contains technical terms. Please make sure you have an idea of the JPA and JAXB.

During the ingest procedure, the KIT-DM generates metadata and stores them in a relational database. 
For migration, the relational data is converted to xml with the help of JAXB. The KIT-DM specific 
representation of the data entities contains cycles, which cannot be handled with JAXB. In addition, 
the JPA creates a big structure, where only a part of it is necessary. 

To create the migration xml file the class MigrationObject is composed, which contains all 
entities. The connection between the entities is established with the primary keys of the 
origin repository. During the insertion, the primary keys are not set for new entities in 
the destination repository because they will have different primary keys. 

The fact, that primary keys change makes it necessary to identify entities uniquely. This 
is difficult for entities without a unique identifier like `Relation` or `Participant`. 
For those entities, the IDs of the related entities will be used for identification.
