    <h1>Staging Handlers</h1>
    All classes in this package are responsible for handling staging operations. These operations contain validation of settings, 
    the preparation of destination folders, optionally preparing a transfer client and performing post-transfer operations. Depending 
    on the transfer type (Ingest or Downloads) one of the two handlers is used by the StagingService.
