        This package contains available Staging Access Points. They define the protocol which is used to access a specific caching location used for 
        staging operations. Furthermore, they are responsible for providing the exact location as well as its mapping between locally and remotely
        accessable representations of a caching folder that should be used for a specific transfer. This folder might be obtained via simple concatenation
        of fields (e.g. userId, objectId, transferId) or via complex rules (e.g. hiding single components of the local access URL in the remote access URL).
